# Lock Resources with Azure Resource Manager

As an administrator, there are scenarios where you will want to place a lock on a resource or resource group to prevent other users in your organization from 
committing write actions or accidentally deleting a critical resource. 

Azure Resource Manager provides the ability to restrict operations on resources through resource management locks. Resource locks are policies which enforce a lock level at a particular scope.  
The lock level identifies the type of enforcement for the policy, which presently has two values � **CanNotDelete** and **ReadOnly**. The scope is expressed as a URI and can be either a 
resource or a resource group.

Locks are different from assigning user permissions to perform certain actions. To learn about setting permissions for users and roles, see 
[Role-based access control in the preview portal](role-based-access-control-configure.md) and [Managing and Auditing Access to Resources](resource-group-rbac.md).

## Common Scenarios

One common scenario is when you have a resource group with some resources that are used in an off-and-on pattern.  VM resources are turned on periodically to process data for a given interval of 
time and then turned off. In this scenario, you will want to enable the shut down of the VMs but it is imperative 
that a storage account not be deleted. In this scenario, you would use a resource lock with a lock level of **CanNotDelete** on the storage account.

In another scenario, your business may have periods where you don't want updates going into production. The **ReadOnly** lock level stops creation or updates.   
If you�re a retail company, you may not want to allow updates during holiday shopping periods.  If you�re a financial services company, you may have constraints related to deployments during 
certain market hours. A resource lock can provide a policy to lock the resources as appropriate. This could be applied to just certain resources or to the entirety of the resource group.

## Creating a Lock in a Template

The example below shows a template that creates a lock on a storage account. The storage account on which to apply the lock is provided as a parameter, and that is used 
in conjunction with the concat() function.  The result is the resource name appended with �Microsoft.Authorization� and then a name of the lock, in this case **myLock**.

The type provided is specific to the resource type. For storage, this type is "Microsoft.Storage/storageaccounts/providers/locks".

The scope level is set using the **level** property of the resource. As the example is focused on helping avoid accidental deletion, the level is set as **CannotDelete**.

    {
        "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
        "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
        "parameters": {
            "lockedResource": {
                "type": "string"
            }
        },
        "resources": [
            {
                "name": "[concat(parameters('lockedResource'), '/Microsoft.Authorization/myLock')]",
                "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/providers/locks",
                "apiVersion": "2015-01-01",
                "properties": {
	                "level": "CannotDelete"
                }
            }
        ]
    }

## Creating a Lock with REST API

You can lock deployed resources with the [REST API for management locks](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt204563.aspx). The REST API enables you to create and delete locks, and 
retrieve information about existing locks.

To create a lock, run:

    PUT https://management.azure.com/{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/locks/{lock-name}?api-version={api-version}

The scope could be a subscription, resource group or resource. The lock-name is whatever you want to call the lock. For api-version, use **2015-01-01**.

In the request, include a JSON object that specifies the properties for the lock.

    {
        "properties": {
            "level": {lock-level},
            "notes": "Optional text notes."
        }
    } 

For lock-level, specify either **CanNotDelete** or **ReadOnly**.

For examples, see [REST API for management locks](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt204563.aspx).

## Creating a Lock with Azure PowerShell

You can lock deployed resources with Azure PowerShell by using the **New-AzureResourceLock** as shown below.

    PS C:\> New-AzureResourceLock -LockLevel CanNotDelete -LockName LockSite -ResourceName examplesite -ResourceType Microsoft.Web/sites -ResourceGroupName ExampleGroup

PowerShell provides other commands for working locks, such as **Set-AzureResourceLock** to update a lock and **Remove-AzureResourceLock** to delete a lock.
