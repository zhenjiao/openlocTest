1.	Sign in to the online [Microsoft Azure Preview portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2.	In the Jumpbar, click **New**, then click **Data + Storage**, and then click **Azure DocumentDB**.

3. In the **New DocumentDB account** blade, specify the desired configuration for the DocumentDB account.

	- In the **ID** box, enter a name to identify the DocumentDB account.  When the **ID** is validated, a green check mark appears in the **ID** box. The **ID** value becomes the host name within the URI. The **ID** may contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and the '-' character, and must be between 3 and 50 characters. Note that *documents.azure.com* is appended to the endpoint name you choose, the result of which will become your DocumentDB account endpoint.

	- The **Account tier** lens is locked because DocumentDB supports a single standard account tier. For more information, see [DocumentDB pricing](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=402317&clcid=0x409).

	- In **Resource group**, select or create a resource group for your DocumentDB account.  By default, a new Resource group will be created.  You may, however, choose to select an existing resource group to which you would like to add your DocumentDB account. For more information, see [Using resource groups to manage your Azure resources](resource-group-portal.md).

	- For **Subscription**, select the Azure subscription that you want to use for the DocumentDB account. If your account has only one subscription, that account is selected by default.
 
	- Use **Location** to specify the geographic location in which to host your DocumentDB account.   

4.	Once the new DocumentDB account options are configured, click **Create**.  It can take a few minutes for the DocumentDB account to be created.  To check the status, you can monitor the progress on the Startboard.

	Or, you can monitor your progress from the Notifications hub.

5.	After the DocumentDB account is created, it is ready for use with the default settings in the online portal. Note that the default consistency of the DocumentDB account is set to **Session**.  You can adjust the default consistency setting by clicking the **Default Consistency** tile on the **DocumentDB account** blade.
