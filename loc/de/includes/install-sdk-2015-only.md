## <a name="setupdevenv"></a>Set up the development environment

To start, set up your development environment by installing the [Azure SDK for Visual Studio 2015](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=518003).

If you don't have Visual Studio installed, Visual Studio Express for Web will be installed along with the SDK.

>[AZURE.NOTE] Depending on how many of the SDK dependencies you already have on your machine, installing the SDK could take a long time, from several minutes to a half hour or more.
