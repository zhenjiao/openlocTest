# Application Insights for Windows Phone and Store apps

*Application Insights is in preview.*

[AZURE.INCLUDE [app-insights-selector-get-started](../../includes/app-insights-selector-get-started.md)]

Visual Studio Application Insights lets you monitor your published application for:

* [**Usage**][windowsUsage] - Learn how many users you have and what they are doing with your app.
* [**Crashes**][windowsCrash] - Get diagnostic reports of crashes and understand their impact on users.

![](./media/app-insights-windows-get-started/appinsights-d018-oview.png)

For many application types, [Visual Studio can add Application Insights to your app](#ide) almost without you noticing. But since you're reading this to get a better understanding of what's going on, we'll take you through the steps manually.

You'll need:

* A subscription to [Microsoft Azure][azure].
* Visual Studio 2013 or later.

## 1. Create an Application Insights resource 

In the [Azure portal][portal], create a new Application Insights resource.

![Choose New, Developer Services, Application Insights](./media/app-insights-windows-get-started/01-new.png)

A [resource][roles] in Azure is an instance of a service. This resource is where telemetry from your app will be analyzed and presented to you.

#### Copy the Instrumentation Key

The key identifies the resource. You'll need it soon, to configure the SDK to send the data to the resource.

![Open the Essentials drop-down drawer and select the instrumentation key](./media/app-insights-windows-get-started/02-props.png)


## 2. Add the Application Insights SDK to your apps

In Visual Studio, add the appropriate SDK to your project.

If it's a Windows Universal app, repeat the steps for both the Windows Phone project and the Windows project.

1. Right-click the project in Solution Explorer and choose **Manage NuGet Packages**.

    ![](./media/app-insights-windows-get-started/03-nuget.png)

2. Search for "Application Insights".

    ![](./media/app-insights-windows-get-started/04-ai-nuget.png)

3. Pick **Application Insights for Windows Applications**

4. Add an ApplicationInsights.config file to the root of your solution and insert the instrumentation key copied from above. A sample xml for this config file is shown below. **Make sure to mark the ApplicationInsights.config file Build Action to "Content" and Copy to Output Directory to "Copy always"**.

	```xml
		<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
		<ApplicationInsights>
			<InstrumentationKey>YOUR COPIED KEY FROM ABOVE</InstrumentationKey>
		</ApplicationInsights>
	```
	
	![](./media/app-insights-windows-get-started/AIConfigFileSettings.png)

5. Add the following initilization code. It is recommended to add this code to the `App()` constructor. If this initialization is not done in the app constructor, you may miss intiial auto collection of pageviews.  

```C#
	public App()
	{
	   // Add this initilization line. 
	   WindowsAppInitializer.InitializeAsync();
	
	   this.InitializeComponent();
	   this.Suspending += OnSuspending;
	}  
```

**Windows Universal apps**: Repeat the steps for both the Phone and the Store project. [Example of a Windows 8.1 Universal app](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Home/tree/master/Samples/Windows%208.1%20Universal).

## <a name="network"></a>3. Enable network access for your app

If your app doesn't already [request outgoing network access](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh452752.aspx), you'll have to add that to its manifest as a [required capability](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br211477.aspx).

## <a name="run"></a>4. Run your project

[Run your application with F5](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/bg161304.aspx) and use it, so as to generate some telemetry. 

In Visual Studio, you'll see a count of the events that have been received.

![](./media/app-insights-windows-get-started/appinsights-09eventcount.png)

In debug mode, telemetry is sent as soon as it's generated. In release mode, telemetry is stored on the device and sent only when the app resumes.


## <a name="monitor"></a>5. See monitor data

Open Application Insights from your project.

![Right-click your project and open the Azure portal](./media/app-insights-windows-get-started/appinsights-04-openPortal.png)


At first, you'll just see one or two points. For example:

![Click through to more data](./media/app-insights-windows-get-started/appinsights-26-devices-01.png)

Click Refresh after a few seconds if you're expecting more data.

Click any chart to see more detail. 


## <a name="deploy"></a>5. Publish your application to Store

[Publish your application](http://dev.windows.com/publish) and watch the data accumulate as users download and use it.

## Customize your telemetry

#### Choosing the collectors

Application Insights SDK Includes several collectors, which collect different types of data from your app automatically. By default, they are all active. But you can choose which collectors to initialize in the app constructor:

    WindowsAppInitializer.InitializeAsync( "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
       WindowsCollectors.Metadata
       | WindowsCollectors.PageView
       | WindowsCollectors.Session 
       | WindowsCollectors.UnhandledException);

#### Send your own telemetry data

Use the [API][api] to send events, metrics and diagnostic data to Application Insights. In summary:

```C#

 var tc = new TelemetryClient(); // Call once per thread

 // Send a user action or goal:
 tc.TrackEvent("Win Game");

 // Send a metric:
 tc.TrackMetric("Queue Length", q.Length);

 // Provide properties by which you can filter events:
 var properties = new Dictionary{"game", game.Name};

 // Provide metrics associated with an event:
 var measurements = new Dictionary{"score", game.score};

 tc.TrackEvent("Win Game", properties, measurements);

```

For more detail, see [Custom Events and Metrics][api].

## <a name="ide"></a>Automated setup

If you prefer to let Visual Studio perform the setup steps, you can do that with Windows Phone, Windows Store, and many other types of apps.

###<a name="new"></a> If you're creating a new Windows app project ...

Select Application Insights in the New Project dialog. 

If you're asked to sign in, use the credentials for your Azure account (which is separate from your Visual Studio Online account).

![](./media/app-insights-windows-get-started/appinsights-d21-new.png)


###<a name="existing"></a> Or if it's an existing project ...

Add Application Insights from Solution Explorer.


![](./media/app-insights-windows-get-started/appinsights-d22-add.png)

## To upgrade to a new release of the SDK

When a [new SDK version is released](app-insights-release-notes-windows.md):
* Right-click your project and choose Manage NuGet Packages. 
* Select the installed Application Insights packages and choose Action: Upgrade.
