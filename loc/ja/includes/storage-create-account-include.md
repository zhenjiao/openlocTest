## Create an Azure storage account

The easiest way to create your first Azure storage account is by using the [Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com). To learn more, see [Create a storage account](../articles/storage/storage-create-storage-account.md#create-a-storage-account).

You can create an Azure storage account by using [Azure PowerShell](../articles/storage/storage-powershell-guide-full.md) or [Azure CLI](../articles/storage/storage-azure-cli.md), or by using the [Azure Storage Resource Provider REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt163683.aspx).
