This tutorial is based on the code you download in the Mobile Services quickstart. Before you start this tutorial, you must first complete either [Get started with Mobile Services] or [Add Mobile Services to an existing app]. 

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] If you completed the quickstart tutorial prior to the release of Azure Mobile Services Android SDK 2.0, you must re-do it, because the SDK is not backwards compatible. To verify the version, check the **dependencies** section of your project's **build.gradle** file.
