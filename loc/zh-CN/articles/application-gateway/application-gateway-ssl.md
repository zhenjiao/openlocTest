# Configure an Application Gateway for SSL offload

Application Gateway can be configured to terminate the SSL session at the gateway, which can avoid costly SSL decryption on the web farm. SSL offload also simplifies the frontend server setup and management of the application.

## Before you begin

1. Install latest version of the Azure PowerShell cmdlets using the Web Platform Installer. You can download and install the latest version from the **Windows PowerShell** section of the [Download page](http://azure.microsoft.com/downloads/).
2. Verify that you have a working virtual network with a valid subnet.
3. Verify that you have backend servers either in the virtual network, or with a public IP/VIP assigned.

To configure SSL offload on an Application Gateway, do the following steps in the order listed.

1. [Create a new application gateway](#create-a-new-application-gateway)
2. [Upload SSL certificates](#upload-ssl-certificates) 
3. [Configure the gateway](#configure-the-gateway)
4. [Set the gateway configuration](#set-the-gateway-configuration)
5. [Start the gateway](#start-the-gateway)
6. [Verify the gateway status](#verify-the-gateway-status)


## Create a new application gateway

**To create the gateway**, use the `New-AzureApplicationGateway` cmdlet, replacing the values with your own. Note that billing for the gateway does not start at this point. Billing begins in a later step, when the gateway is successfully started.

This sample shows the cmdlet on the first line, followed by the output. 

	PS C:\> New-AzureApplicationGateway -Name AppGwTest -VnetName testvnet1 -Subnets @("Subnet-1")

	VERBOSE: 4:31:35 PM - Begin Operation: New-AzureApplicationGateway 
	VERBOSE: 4:32:37 PM - Completed Operation: New-AzureApplicationGateway
	Name       HTTP Status Code     Operation ID                             Error 
	----       ----------------     ------------                             ----
	Successful OK                   55ef0460-825d-2981-ad20-b9a8af41b399

**To validate** that the gateway was created, you can use the `Get-AzureApplicationGateway` cmdlet.


In the sample, *Description*, *InstanceCount*, and *GatewaySize* are optional parameters. The default value for *InstanceCount* is 2, with a maximum value of 10. The default value for *GatewaySize* is Medium. Small and Large are other available values. *Vip* and *DnsName* are shown as blank because the gateway has not started yet. These will be created once the gateway is in the running state.

This sample shows the cmdlet on the first line, followed by the output. 

	PS C:\> Get-AzureApplicationGateway AppGwTest

	VERBOSE: 4:39:39 PM - Begin Operation:
	Get-AzureApplicationGateway VERBOSE: 4:39:40 PM - Completed 
	Operation: Get-AzureApplicationGateway
	Name: AppGwTest	
	Description: 
	VnetName: testvnet1 
	Subnets: {Subnet-1} 
	InstanceCount: 2 
	GatewaySize: Medium 
	State: Stopped 
	VirtualIPs: 
	DnsName:


## Upload SSL certificates 

Use `Add-AzureApplicationGatewaySslCertificate` to upload the server certificate in *pfx* format to the application gateway. The certificate name is a user-chosen name and must be unique within the application gateway. This certificate is referred to by this name in all certificate management operations on the application gateway.

This sample shows the cmdlet on the first line, followed by the output. Replace the values in the sample with your own.

	PS C:\> Add-AzureApplicationGatewaySslCertificate  -Name AppGwTest -CertificateName GWCert -Password <password> -CertificateFile <full path to pfx file> 
	
	VERBOSE: 5:05:23 PM - Begin Operation: Get-AzureApplicationGatewaySslCertificate 
	VERBOSE: 5:06:29 PM - Completed Operation: Get-AzureApplicationGatewaySslCertificate
	Name       HTTP Status Code     Operation ID                             Error 
	----       ----------------     ------------                             ----
	Successful OK                   21fdc5a0-3bf7-2c12-ad98-192e0dd078ef

Next, validate the certificate upload. Use the `Get-AzureApplicationGatewayCertificate`.

This sample shows the cmdlet on the first line, followed by the output. 

	PS C:\> Get-AzureApplicationGatewaySslCertificate AppGwTest 

	VERBOSE: 5:07:54 PM - Begin Operation: Get-AzureApplicationGatewaySslCertificate 
	VERBOSE: 5:07:55 PM - Completed Operation: Get-AzureApplicationGatewaySslCertificate
	Name           : SslCert 
	SubjectName    : CN=gwcert.app.test.contoso.com 
	Thumbprint     : AF5ADD77E160A01A6......EE48D1A 
	ThumbprintAlgo : sha1RSA
	State..........: Provisioned


## Configure the gateway

An application gateway configuration consists of multiple values. The values can be tied together to construct the configuration. 

The values are:
 
- **Backend server pool:** The list of IP addresses of the backend servers. The IP addresses listed should either belong to the VNet subnet, or should be a public IP/VIP. 
- **Backend server pool settings:** Every pool has settings like port, protocol, and cookie based affinity. These settings are tied to a pool and are applied to all servers within the pool.
- **Frontend Port:** This port is the public port opened on the application gateway. Traffic hits this port, and then gets redirected to one of the backend servers.
- **Listener:** The listener has a frontend port, a protocol (Http or Https, these are case-sensitive), and the SSL certificate name (if configuring SSL offload). 
- **Rule:** The rule binds the listener and the backend server pool and defines which backend server pool the traffic should be directed to when it hits a particular listener. Currently, only the *basic* rule is supported. The *basic* rule is round-robin load distribution.

**Additional configuration notes:**

For SSL certificates configuration, the protocol in **HttpListener** should change to *Https* (case sensitive). The **SslCert** element needs to be added to **HttpListener** with the value set to the same name as used in upload of SSL certificates section above. The frontend port should be updated to 443.

**To enable cookie based affinity**: An application gateway can be configured to ensure that request from a client session is always directed to the same VM in the web farm. This is done by injection of a session cookie which allows the gateway to direct traffic appropriately. To enable cookie based affinity, set **CookieBasedAffinity** to *Enabled* in the **BackendHttpSettings** element. 



You can construct your configuration either by creating a configuration object, or by using a configuration XML file. 
To construct your configuration by using a configuration XML file, use the sample below.

**Configuration XML sample**


	    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

	        </HttpLoadBalancingRule>
	    </HttpLoadBalancingRules>
	</ApplicationGatewayConfiguration>


## Set the gateway configuration

Next, you'll set the application gateway. You can use the `Set-AzureApplicationGatewayConfig` cmdlet with either a configuration object, or with a configuration XML file.


	PS C:\> Set-AzureApplicationGatewayConfig -Name AppGwTest -ConfigFile D:\config.xml

	VERBOSE: 7:54:59 PM - Begin Operation: Set-AzureApplicationGatewayConfig 
	VERBOSE: 7:55:32 PM - Completed Operation: Set-AzureApplicationGatewayConfig
	Name       HTTP Status Code     Operation ID                             Error 
	----       ----------------     ------------                             ----
	Successful OK                   9b995a09-66fe-2944-8b67-9bb04fcccb9d

## Start the gateway

Once the gateway has been configured, use the `Start-AzureApplicationGateway` cmdlet to start the gateway. Billing for an application gateway begins after the gateway has been successfully started. 


**Note:** The `Start-AzureApplicationGateway` cmdlet might take up to 15-20 minutes to complete. 

   
	PS C:\> Start-AzureApplicationGateway AppGwTest 

	VERBOSE: 7:59:16 PM - Begin Operation: Start-AzureApplicationGateway 
	VERBOSE: 8:05:52 PM - Completed Operation: Start-AzureApplicationGateway
	Name       HTTP Status Code     Operation ID                             Error 
	----       ----------------     ------------                             ----
	Successful OK                   fc592db8-4c58-2c8e-9a1d-1c97880f0b9b


## Verify the gateway status

Use the `Get-AzureApplicationGateway` cmdlet to check the status of gateway. If *Start-AzureApplicationGateway* succeeded in the previous step, the State should be *Running*, and the Vip and DnsName should have valid entries. 

This sample shows an application gateway that is up, running, and is ready to take traffic 

	PS C:\> Get-AzureApplicationGateway AppGwTest 

	Name          : AppGwTest2
	Description   : 
	VnetName      : testvnet1
	Subnets       : {Subnet-1}
	InstanceCount : 2
	GatewaySize   : Medium
	State         : Running
	VirtualIPs    : {23.96.22.241}
	DnsName       : appgw-4c960426-d1e6-4aae-8670-81fd7a519a43.cloudapp.net
