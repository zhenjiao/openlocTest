#### To install Update 1 from the Management Portal

1. On the StorSimple service page, select your device. Navigate to **Devices** > **Maintenance**.

2. At the bottom of the page, click **Scan Updates**. A job will be created to scan for available updates. You will be notified when the job has completed successfully.

3. In the **Software Updates** section on the same page, you will see that new software updates are available. We recommend that you review the release notes before you apply Update 1.0 on your device.

    The following is an example in which the pre-upgrade check failed. You will need to verify that both the device controllers are healthy and online. You will also need to check the health of the hardware components. In this example, Controller 0 and Controller 1 components need attention. You may need to contact Microsoft Support if you cannot address these issues by yourself.

8. After the pre-upgrade checks are successfully completed, an update job will be created. You will be notified when the update job is successfully created.
