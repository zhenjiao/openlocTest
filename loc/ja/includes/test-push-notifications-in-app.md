## <a id="test"></a>Test Push Notifications in App

* Press **Run** in Xcode and start the app on an actual iOS device (not the simulator.) Then click **OK** to accept push notifications. You must explicitly accept push notifications from your app; this request occurs only the first time that the app runs.

* In the app, add a new item, such as _A new Mobile Services task_ and then click the **+** icon.

* Verify that a notification is received, then click **OK** to dismiss the notification. You have now successfully completed this tutorial.
